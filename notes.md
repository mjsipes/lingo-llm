okay i should share all my links to this project somewhere. just so everything about this proejct is documented. now with my idea of rolling averages, rag sounds very unique, im basically doing a log first search accurately and rag is like a hashmap. they are kind of like the datastructures of ai. this is ata least unti we understand how to put the datastructures into the ai, that will be a whole nother thing, but right now we are in an age of combinging classical computing with ai to make something poweferul, until ai does all of classical computing as well. that is a good qeustion, when will ai do all of classical computing as well?

like when will the ai itself be able to use those datastructures? and these should be datastructures, not full on products.
