**Live App: https://lingo-llm.vercel.app/**

Lingo LLM is a language learning website where users can engage with little anthropomorphic characters to learn Spanish through AI-powered storytelling.

## TLDR
I started learning Spanish this summer, downloaded Duolingo, but it felt like Khan Academy. When I asked Claude to translate a news article into Spanish, our conversation evolved into creating fictional Spanish-English stories. I wanted to expand on Claude's capabilities by adding image generation and creating an experience designed for children with a universe of helpful animal characters.

## What it does

Lingo LLM introduces kids to AI orchestration through language learning. Instead of one monolithic AI, children interact with specialized anthropomorphic characters, each with unique abilities. This teaches them how to coordinate different AI agents while making Spanish learning feel like playing with friends.

The core experience revolves around **Pingu**, the main storyteller who controls the chat interface. Children can summon specialized helpers:
- **Palette the Camel** and **Panda the Painter** turn conversations into illustrated stories
- Single-purpose agents provide feedback, inspiration, randomness, and translation
- Each character responds instantly in dialogue format through tooltips

## Why this matters

We might be heading toward a future where children learn from AI or orchestrate AI agents. While we call this "prompt engineering," how do we make it intuitive for kids? Lingo LLM explores this by hiding the complexity of tool calling and agent coordination behind the simple concept: "these are your friends, and they can help you with specific tasks."

The app addresses a fundamental question about AI's future: Will we have one super-intelligent agent, or will the most powerful entity be the dynamic duo of human + coordinated AI? This project was my exploration into what our experience with orchestrating and learning from AI agents might look like in the future.

## How it works

Children can interact with characters in two ways:
1. **Main conversation** with Pingu for natural language learning
2. **Quick agent calls** using specialized helper buttons - even spam-clicking generates different responses for instant feedback

The Spanish learning happens through collaborative storytelling, where AI agents help create multilingual narratives that make language acquisition feel like creative play rather than studying.

## System Architecture

Lingo LLM uses a multi-agent AI system with intelligent context management. The backend connects to three AI services: Claude 4 Sonnet for reasoning, OpenAI for image generation and audio, and Groq for fast responses. Each character is designed with specific capabilities that map to these underlying services.

The system maintains conversation context through smart summarization: persistent messages get condensed into background context, while selected text becomes the immediate subject. This allows image-generating agents to create relevant visuals and keeps all characters contextually aware without overwhelming the models.
