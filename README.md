UC Berkeley's AI Hackathon is back! Cal Hacks will be bringing you two days of hacking on the best AI technology the world has to offer. With support from Anthropic, Google, Fetch AI, and more, this will be a monumental event no future AI/LLM developer can afford to miss. You'll even have chance to pitch your project to investors, and win cash prizes! This event is your chance to explore the potential of large language models and other open source APIs, all while making a lasting impact in the world of artificial intelligence.











the goal of this app is to be a way for kids to interact and learn with ai. we might one day end up living in a world were kids learn from ai, or kdis are orchestrating ai, and we all are practising that calling it prompt engineering, but what is a good way for kids to think about it? so the list of chat helper buttons and prompting box are two rows . the top row has a list for 4-5 different agents. they will be implements as buttons with an avatar inside it and a little description for each, just enough for their name. it will be like artist, enthusiast, judge, idea generator, and so when you click on them it sends whatever message was in the prompt box to that agent, and they responde into a shadcn tooltip so it kind of looks like dialogue. so like if i want the randome word generator i can just tap him spam and even though there is nothing in the prompt box it just wont send anything to the model. but it does send a request to that function each time so the tooltip will just keep changing with the different responses the avatar spits out. 

how will kids learn to interact with and orchestrate agents, that is if we end up in a world with the agent verse, or will we just have one agent that is super good at everything? its lkind of like in ai we are goin through the history of religion . is there one god or many gods? 

there is no way to tell what the future will be like with ai and humans.
right now  we can learn from llms and orchestrate them.
this time may pass. we may live in a future where ai is more powerful alone than in partnership with us.
but we may also live for al ong time in a world where the most powerful is the dynamic duo of human and ai, and then our job is to orchestrate ai.
ai might just take over the world and there be nothing we can do to make the world more productive.
but the future could also be more so heading in the direction of orchestration. maybe we hit a physical limit soon where the ai;s just cant have a lot of context for a long time and the most powerful entinty is the dynamic duo of human and ai. If thats the
so if thats the future we live in, how do we teach kids to learn from llms, orchestrate these llms, and what does this experience look like? 

i focused on the specif usecase of writing multi lingual stories with ai to help learn a language

this was my exploration into what this experience may looks like. The child as they are learning can call to these different anthromorphic characters, each serving their own purpose. In the real world these can be separate ai agents that perform different tasks or the different tools that one agent can perform.
I wanted to make it intuitive for children, something they could digest and get the hang of. 

they have atthere is the main ai agent they talk with llm lione. he is like the main thread and controls the chat interface. but then there are two special agent that help turn the conversation into a story. there is wrigley the writer and dingo dalle. they have special ablities, they can generate images and add the content from the chat into the story. then there is a group of single purpose agents with specific usecases, they can give feedback, inspiration, seeds of randomness, and translation. The goal with these agents is to be fast, and respond as if its dialogue. 

i hid the complexity of tools calling and agent verse behind the idea that, these are your friends, and they can help you with a specific task.
