All characters are illustrated in a cinematic cartoon style that feels cohesive, expressive, and friendly — ideal for a learning platform for children. The visual tone is inspired by the charm of modern animated films with a soft, polished look that appeals to both kids and adults.

Core Style Attributes:
- Clean line art with polished outlines
- Vector-style cartoon illustration
- Soft, rounded shapes for all body features
- Large, expressive eyes that convey warmth and personality
- Gentle blush on cheeks for approachability
- Warm, soft lighting that casts subtle, cozy shadows under characters
- White background only, subtly textured with minimal gradients or abstract ambient shapes (like clouds, blobs, or sparkles), keeping the focus on the character
- Navy blue business suits with white shirts and black ties (unless the role calls for a specific variation, like rolled-up sleeves or art splatters)
- Each character includes a prop or pose that reinforces their role, such as:
  - Microphones for translators
  - Paintbrushes for artists
  - Notebooks for critics
  - Floating ideas for dreamers
  - Multiple objects being juggled by multitaskers

Overall Vibe:
- Professional but playful – they look like a kid-friendly startup crew
- Cohesive and stylized, as if they all come from the same cinematic universe
- Designed to be immediately readable, engaging, and emotionally expressive for children in an educational setting`;
