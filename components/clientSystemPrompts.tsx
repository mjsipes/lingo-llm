- Warm, soft lighting that casts subtle, cozy shadows under characters

- Navy blue business suits with white shirts and black ties (unless the role calls for a specific variation, like rolled-up sleeves or art splatters)
- Each character includes a prop or pose that reinforces their role, such as:
  - Microphones for translators
  - Paintbrushes for artists
  - Notebooks for critics
  - Floating ideas for dreamers
  - Multiple objects being juggled by multitaskers
